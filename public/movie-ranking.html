<h3>Little Women</h3>

<p>How does it feel to rediscover girlhood, family and friendships through the lens of this modern retelling of a 19th century classic? There is something so surreal about this movie that i just cant let it go. The joy of dancing with people you deeply care about, the heartbreak of losing friends, passage of time, the anxiety of having no one left to love... hits way too close.</p>
<h3>Maheshinte Prathikaram (Mahesh's Revenge)</h3>

<p>Incredibly simple in its premise and comforting in its execution, this is a Malayalam language movie following the life of a small photographer in a hill town. Accompanied by witty writing and some great visuals, perfect for a rainy day watch.</p>
<h3>Mayaanadhi (The Mystic River)</h3>

<p>Inspired by Breathless, Mayaanadhi places a familiar but tumultous love story in the backdrop of urban Kochi and lets it characters breathe (pun intended). Following two people who are already in love, the movie skirts away from the usual trappings of romance tropes and presents a fresh and heartbreaking take on love while being both real and relatable.</p>
